<p>Karl Marx[b] FRSA[4] (5 May 1818 – 14 March 1883) was a German-born philosopher, economist, political theorist, historian, sociologist, journalist, and revolutionary socialist. <br>
 His best-known works are the 1848 pamphlet The Communist Manifesto (with Friedrich Engels) and the three-volume Das Kapital (1867–1894);<br>
 the latter employs his theory of historical materialism in an analysis of capitalism, representing his greatest intellectual achievement. Marx's ideas and theories and their subsequent development,<br>
 collectively known as Marxism, have exerted enormous influence on modern intellectual, economic, and political history.<br>

Born in Trier in the Kingdom of Prussia, German Confederation, Marx studied at the universities of Bonn, Berlin, and Jena, and received a doctorate in philosophy from the latter in 1841.<br>
 A Young Hegelian, he was influenced by the philosophy of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, and both critiqued and developed Hegel's ideas in works such as The German Ideology (written 1846) and the Grundrisse (written 1857–1858).<br>
 While in Paris in 1844, Marx wrote his Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts and met Engels, a lifelong friend and collaborator. After moving to Brussels in 1845, <br>
 they were active in the Communist League, and in 1848 wrote The Communist Manifesto, which expresses Marx's ideas and ends with a call for revolution: "Working men of all countries, unite!"<br>
 Marx was expelled from Belgium and Germany, and in 1849 moved to London, where he wrote The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (1852) and Das Kapital. In 1864, Marx helped found the International <br>
 Workingmen's Association (First International), in which he sought to fight the influence of anarchists led by Mikhail Bakunin. In his Critique of the Gotha Programme (1875),<br>
 Marx wrote on revolution, the transition to communism, and the state. He died stateless in 1883 and was buried in Highgate Cemetery.<br>

Marx's critical theories about society, economics, and politics hold that human societies develop through class conflict. In the capitalist mode of production, this manifests itself in the<br>
 conflict between the ruling classes (known as the bourgeoisie) that control the means of production and the working classes (known as the proletariat) that enable these means by selling their<br>
 labour-power in return for wages.[5] Employing a critical approach known as historical materialism, Marx predicted that capitalism produced internal tensions like previous socioeconomic systems and<br>
 that these tensions would lead to its self-destruction and replacement by a new system known as the socialist mode of production. For Marx, class antagonisms under capitalism—owing in part to its instability<br>
 and crisis-prone nature—would eventuate the working class's development of class consciousness, leading to their conquest of political power and eventually the establishment of a classless,<br>
 communist society constituted by a free association of producers.[6] Marx actively pressed for its implementation, arguing that the working class should carry out organised proletarian revolutionary action<br>
 to topple capitalism and bring about socio-economic emancipation.[7]<br>

Marx has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history, and his work has been both lauded and criticised.[8] <br>
Marxism has exerted major influence on socialist thought and political movements, and during the 20th century revolutionary governments identifying as Marxist took power in many countries<br>
 and established socialist states including the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. A number of theoretical variants, such as Leninism, Marxism–Leninism, Trotskyism, and Maoism, have been developed.<br>
 Marx's work in economics has a strong influence on modern heterodox theories of labour and its relation to capital,[9][10][11] and he is typically cited as one of the principal architects of modern social science.[12][13]</p>
