   <p style="color:white;"> I read “Mein Kampf” right through for the first time last year, while working on a piece about Timothy Snyder’s history of the Holocaust as it happened in the Slavic and Baltic states during
   the Second World War.<br>
   (Snyder reads Hitler in a somewhat original and provocative way, derived in part from his reading of “Mein Kampf.”)<br>
   I read it in the first English translation, from 1933, with the German version alongside, online, and a crib of graduate-school
   German grammar nearby.<br>
   (I’ve since reread sections, in Ralph Manheim’s later translation.) The question of what to do with “Mein Kampf” is, in some sense, independent of the book’s contents—buying it 
   is a symbolic act before it’s any kind of intellectual one, and you can argue that it’s worth banning on those grounds alone.<br>
   A good opposing case can be made on similarly symbolic grounds: that making it public in Germany is a way of robbing
   it of the glamour of the forbidden.
