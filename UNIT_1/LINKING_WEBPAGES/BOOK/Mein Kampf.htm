      <p style="color:rgb(174, 161, 219);">Mein Kampf ( lit.â€‰'My Struggle') is a 1925 autobiographical manifesto by Nazi Party leader Adolf Hitler.<br>
      The work describes the process by which Hitler became antisemitic and outlines his political ideology and future plans for Germany.<br>
      Volume 1 of Mein Kampf was published in 1925 and Volume 2 in 1926.<br> The book was edited first by Emil Maurice, then by Hitler's deputy Rudolf Hess.<br>
      Hitler began Mein Kampf while imprisoned following his failed coup in Munich in November 1923 and a trial in February 1924 for high treason,<br>
      in which he received a sentence of five years. Although he received many visitors initially, he soon devoted himself entirely to the book.<br>
      As he continued,he realized that it would have to be a two-volume work, with the first volume scheduled for release in early 1925.<br>
      The governor of Landsberg noted at the time that "he [Hitler] hopes the book will run into many editions, thus enabling him to fulfill<br>
      his financial obligations and to defray the expenses incurred at the time of his trial."<br> 
      After slow initial sales, the book became a bestseller in Germany following Hitler's rise to power in 1933.</p>
