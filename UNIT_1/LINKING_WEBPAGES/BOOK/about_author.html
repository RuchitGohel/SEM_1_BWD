     Hitler at a young age was forced to study to become an officer in the military but he had no interest in it and he stood against the decision of his father firmly,<br>
     he had a keen eye for achitecture and was the only subject that he  was interested in studying at school.He went for further study in Austria where he developed an
     envy of his nation's people's condition against the foreign nationals and kept sinking into the ideology of ani-sematics and pure patriotism which eventually led
     him to become a politician and dictator of the 'Deautschland' who statrted the world war 2 and became the infamous dictator all around the world.
