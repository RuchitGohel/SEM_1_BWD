   <p style="color:white;"> In the pages of Mein Kampf Hitler presented the world with his dark vision for the future.<br>
   Years would pass before he attained the power to realize that vision, but&#160;Mein Kampf&;s existence denies the free world the excuse of ignorance.<br>
   We dismissed him as a madman and we ignored his wretched book; the result was a tragedy of unprecedented proportions.<br>
   This is yet another lesson to take from Mein Kampf: the lesson of vigilance and responsibility, of not closing our eyes to the evil around us.&;&;From the introduction by Abraham Foxman
