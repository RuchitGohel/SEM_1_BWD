  <p style="font-size: 20px;">
  Red Bull Racing, currently competing as Oracle Red Bull Racing and also known simply as Red Bull or RBR,<br> 
  is a Formula One racing team, racing under an Austrian licence and based in the United Kingdom.<br> 
  It is one of two Formula One teams owned by conglomerate Red Bull GmbH, the other being Scuderia AlphaTauri.<br> 
  The Red Bull Racing team has been managed by Christian Horner since its formation in 2005.<br>

  Red Bull had Cosworth engines in 2005 and Ferrari engines in 2006.<br>
  The team used engines supplied by Renault between 2007 and 2018 <br>
  (from 2016 to 2018, the Renault engine was re-badged "TAG Heuer" following the breakdown in the relationship between Red Bull and Renault in 2015).<br> 
  During this partnership, they won four successive Drivers' and <br>
  Constructors' Championship titles from 2010 to 2013, becoming the first Austrian team to win the title.<br>
  The team began using Honda engines in 2019.<br> 
  The works Honda partnership culminated in 2021 following Red Bull driver Max Verstappen's World Drivers' Championship victory,<br>
  with Verstappen also winning the championship in 2022. Honda left the sport officially after 2021,<br>
  but is set to continue to supply complete engines from Japan to the team partly under Red Bull Powertrains branding until the end of 2025.<br>
  <br>We would liike to stretch our heartfelt thanks to some of the most important figures of our company who have helped this company achieve what it has.
