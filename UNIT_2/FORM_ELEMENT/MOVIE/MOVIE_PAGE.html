	 <p>
	 This revolting film, already a box office success, is apparently to be mined for another thick profit. I can imagine the series now—“Return of the Godfather,” “Son of the Godfather,” “The Godfather in Las Vegas,” “The Godfather in Miami Beach,”<br>
	 and so stretching on into profitable infinity.
